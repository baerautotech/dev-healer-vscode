# Time-Anchored Decision Making (Required)

Before making any "best practice" or "current direction" decision, anchor on the real current date.

1. Run `date -u` and `date` using the Shell tool.
2. State the results explicitly in the conversation as:
   - `Decision baseline date (UTC): <output of date -u>`
   - `Decision baseline date (local): <output of date>`

Do not rely on vague phrases like "as of today" without first grounding "today" with `date`.

# Policy-Pack Awareness (Org Sync)

If the repo contains `policy-files.json`, this repo has opted into org-level policy sync.

Required behavior:
- Read `policy-files.json` and treat its listed files as policy-managed.
- Do not hand-wave or reinvent org policy; follow the policy-managed files as the source of truth.
- If a policy-managed file should change, propose the change through the policy-pack workflow (do not drift locally).

# Decision Tree (General Guidance)

When multiple viable implementation paths exist:

1. Prefer the path with the strongest compliance/control alignment (auditability, least privilege, clear ownership, and documented operational posture).
2. Prefer the path that matches the current and expected future direction of the platform (avoid dead-ends and vendor/feature lock-in when reasonable).
3. Prefer reversible choices (safe rollout/rollback) and lower long-term operational risk over short-term speed.
4. If the trade-offs depend on missing constraints (compliance target, threat model, platform roadmap), stop and ask the user rather than guessing.
